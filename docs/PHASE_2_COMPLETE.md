# Phase 2 Complete: Stripe Integration ✅

**Completed:** October 5, 2025

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

Successfully integrated **Stripe payments** with Stripe Connect for multi-tenant event ticketing. Organizations can now:
- Connect their own Stripe accounts
- Sell tickets to events
- Receive payments directly (minus platform fee)
- Process refunds

---

## 📦 Stripe Infrastructure Created

### 1. **Stripe Configuration** (`lib/stripe/config.ts`)

Centralized Stripe setup with helper utilities:

**Features:**
- Stripe SDK initialization with latest API version
- Stripe Connect configuration (Standard Connect)
- Platform fee calculation (2.5%)
- Currency conversion utilities (dollars ↔ cents)
- Currency formatting for display

**Helper Functions:**
```typescript
- calculatePlatformFee(amountInCents): number
- dollarsToCents(dollars): number
- centsToDollars(cents): number
- formatCurrency(amountInCents, currency): string
```

### 2. **Stripe Connect Onboarding** (`app/api/stripe/connect/onboard/route.ts`)

API route for onboarding organizations to Stripe Connect.

**Flow:**
1. Verify user is owner/admin of organization
2. Create Stripe Connect account (Standard) if doesn't exist
3. Save `stripe_account_id` to organization
4. Generate onboarding link for KYC/verification
5. Redirect back to dashboard after completion

**Request:**
```json
POST /api/stripe/connect/onboard
{
  "organizationId": "uuid"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://connect.stripe.com/setup/...",
  "stripeAccountId": "acct_..."
}
```

### 3. **Checkout Session Creation** (`app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts`)

API route for creating checkout sessions for ticket purchases.

**Features:**
- Support for both free and paid tickets
- Quantity validation (min/max per order)
- Availability checking
- Platform fee deduction
- Guest checkout support
- Metadata tracking for webhook processing

**Request:**
```json
POST /api/stripe/checkout
{
  "eventId": "uuid",
  "ticketTypeId": "uuid",
  "quantity": 2,
  "email": "user@example.com", // optional if logged in
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

**Response (Paid Tickets):**
```json
{
  "sessionId": "cs_...",
  "url": "https://checkout.stripe.com/..."
}
```

**Response (Free Tickets):**
```json
{
  "registrationId": "uuid",
  "isFree": true
}
```

### 4. **Webhook Handler** (`app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`)

Processes Stripe events for payment lifecycle management.

**Events Handled:**
- `checkout.session.completed` → Create registration + transaction
- `payment_intent.succeeded` → Update transaction status
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` → Mark registration as failed
- `charge.refunded` → Process refunds
- `account.updated` → Track Connect onboarding status

**Security:**
- Signature verification for all webhooks
- Service role access for RLS bypass
- Idempotent event processing

**Database Updates:**
- Creates `event_registrations` records
- Creates `transactions` records
- Updates `ticket_types.quantity_sold`
- Updates organization Stripe status

---

## 🗄 Database Updates

### New Database Function

**`increment_ticket_sold(ticket_id, amount)`**
- Atomically increments `quantity_sold` for ticket types
- Called automatically on successful payment
- Security definer for bypass RLS
