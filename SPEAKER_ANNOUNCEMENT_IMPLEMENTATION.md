## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Parallel AI Generation**
   - All platforms generated simultaneously
   - Reduces total generation time
   - Uses Promise.allSettled for error handling

2. **Database Indexing**
   - Indexes on user_id, event_date, event_location
   - Faster queries for list and filter operations
   - Optimized RLS policy checks

3. **Image Storage**
   - Public bucket for fast delivery
   - CDN-ready setup
   - Lazy loading in UI

4. **Retry Logic**
   - Automatic retry on API failures
   - Exponential backoff
   - Graceful error handling

5. **Caching Opportunities**
   - Generated content stored in database
   - No re-generation on page refresh
   - Manual regeneration when needed

## Cost Considerations

### OpenAI API Costs
- GPT-4o: ~$0.01 per generation (all platforms)
- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per generation
- Approximately 4 completions per speaker
- Bulk generation recommended

### Supabase Costs
- Storage: Minimal (photos only)
- Database: Minimal (text storage)
- API calls: Within free tier for most usage

## Security Implementation

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth integration
- User verification on all operations
- Session management

### Authorization
- Row-level security policies
- User can only access their own data
- Prevents unauthorized access

### Data Validation
- Frontend form validation
- Backend API validation
- Database constraints
- Type safety with TypeScript

### API Key Security
- Environment variables for keys
- Server-side API calls only
- No client-side key exposure
