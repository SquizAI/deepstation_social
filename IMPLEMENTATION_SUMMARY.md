# Events & Profile Features - Implementation Summary

## Quick Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive events calendar and user profile features for DeepStation.

## What Was Built

### 1. Public Events Calendar (Homepage)
- Displays 6 upcoming events in a beautiful grid
- Auto-hides if no events available
- Matches DeepStation's glassmorphism aesthetic
- "View All Events" button

### 2. Event Pages
- **All Events Page** (`/events`) - Shows all upcoming events
- **Event Detail Page** (`/events/[slug]`) - Full event information with registration

### 3. User Profile Dashboard (`/dashboard/profile`)
- **Profile Header** - Avatar, name, bio (editable)
- **My Events Tab** - View registered events (filterable: all/upcoming/past)
- **Settings Tab** - Email preferences, privacy, account management

### 4. Navigation Updates
- Added "Profile" to sidebar
- Added "My Events" to user dropdown menu

/components/layout/navbar.tsx            (Added My Events to dropdown)
```

## Key Features

### Event Registration Flow
1. User clicks "Register Now" on event card
2. If not logged in → Redirect to login
3. If logged in → Show registration button on detail page
4. Click button → Register for event
5. Show confirmation and "Registered" status

### Profile Dashboard
- View all registered events
- Filter by upcoming/past events
- Edit profile information
- Manage email and privacy settings

## Database Tables Used

```sql
events                 (Event information)
event_registrations    (User event registrations)
profiles              (User profile data)
```

## Design Highlights

- **Glassmorphism**: `bg-white/5 backdrop-blur-sm border border-white/10`
- **Gradients**: Fuchsia to purple (`from-fuchsia-500 to-purple-600`)
- **Hover Effects**: Scale transforms and glow shadows
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind breakpoints
- **Server Components**: Fast initial page loads
- **Client Components**: Interactive features where needed

## User Journey

### 1. Discovering Events
Homepage → Events Section → Click Event Card → Event Detail Page

### 2. Registering for Event
Event Detail → Click "Register Now" → Login (if needed) → Register → Confirmation

### 3. Managing Events
Dashboard → Profile → My Events Tab → View/Filter Events

## What's Working

- Events display on homepage
- Event detail pages with registration
- Profile page with editable information
- My Events tab with filtering
- Settings tab with preferences
- Navigation links properly configured
- Responsive design on all screen sizes
- Loading and error states
- Authentication redirects

## What Needs Backend Implementation

1. **Profile Avatar Upload** - Supabase Storage integration
2. **Email Notifications** - Registration confirmations, reminders
3. **Settings Persistence** - Save email/privacy preferences to database
4. **Password Change** - Update auth credentials
5. **Data Export** - Generate user data file
6. **Account Deletion** - Remove user and associated data

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Calendar integration (Google Calendar, iCal)
- [ ] Event search and advanced filtering
- [ ] Event analytics and insights
- [ ] Ticket/payment integration
- [ ] Event check-in system
- [ ] Social sharing for events
- [ ] Event waitlist functionality
- [ ] Workshop/series events

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** - App Router with Server Components
- **React 19** - Client Components for interactivity
- **Supabase** - Database, Auth, and Real-time
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling with custom glassmorphism
- **TypeScript** - Type safety throughout
- **date-fns** - Date formatting

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create test events in Supabase
2. Test registration flow (logged in and logged out)
3. Verify event filtering on profile page
4. Check responsive design on mobile
5. Test empty states (no events, no registrations)
6. Verify navigation links
7. Test error handling (full events, network errors)
