8. Email sent (needs backend implementation)

### Profile Flow

2. Sees profile header with editable info
3. Can view registered events in "My Events" tab
4. Filter events by status (upcoming/past)
5. Click event to view details
6. Manage settings in "Settings" tab

## File Paths Summary

### Created Files:
```
/components/events/events-calendar-section.tsx
/components/events/simple-event-card.tsx
/components/events/event-registration-button.tsx
/components/profile/profile-header.tsx
/components/profile/profile-tabs.tsx
/app/events/page.tsx
/app/events/[slug]/simple-event-page.tsx
/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx
```

### Modified Files:
```
/app/page.tsx
/components/layout/sidebar.tsx
/components/layout/navbar.tsx
```

## Notes

- The existing event system had a more complex schema with ticket types, location types, etc. The simple event card and pages work with both schemas.
- The existing `/app/events/[slug]/page.tsx` uses a more complex event structure. The `simple-event-page.tsx` is provided as an alternative for simpler schemas.
- Profile avatar upload UI is present but backend implementation needed.
- Email notifications are referenced but need backend implementation (consider using Supabase Edge Functions with Resend or SendGrid).
- Settings toggles are UI-only and need backend persistence.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete events and profile system with:
- Beautiful, responsive UI matching DeepStation branding
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Client-side interactivity where needed
- Proper authentication flows
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensible architecture for future features
